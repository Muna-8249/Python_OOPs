        "\n",
        "    - Method chaining in python OOP is a programming technique that allows for multiple method calls to be invoked sequentially on the same object in a single concise expression. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself(Usually self).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How its Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * **Method Definition:** In a class, methods designed for chaining perform their respective operations and then explicitly return 'self'.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * **Sequential Invocation:** When an object calls the first method in a chain, that method executes and return the object. This returned object then immediately calls the next method in the chain and so on."
